    Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning(PPDL) is a technique that enables to deep learning without revealing the original image contents on cloud environments.
    However, conventional PPDL methods are difficult to use in practical because of some problems, such as the inability to apply the state-of-the-art deep learning models or poor accuracy.
    To take advantage of the results of advanced deep learning studies, we proposed a new PPDL method that can only reduce human identification.
    Based on the study that the human’s perceptual system is sensitive to structural change, we convert images into vector format to modify the parts of position.
    And we modify brightness of the image to make a difference between each dataset generated using the proposed method.
    The privacy-protected images generated by proposed method can be trained using any DNN model. And data augmentation techniques such as flip and shifting can also be used even in encrypted states, because final image form is identical to the original form.
    Also, we proposed a new measurement method that combines the  method, which measures how much human perception has decreased, with the  distance, which is commonly used for Generative Adversarial Network(GAN).
    Through the measurement method, we are able to derive the trade-off between object classification performance and object privacy in input image, and to choose the optimal parameters for CIFAR-10.
    Finally, we conducted various experiments using CIFAR-10, and from the evaluation results, we show that the proposed method is valid and effective for PPDL.
